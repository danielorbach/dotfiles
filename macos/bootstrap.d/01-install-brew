# The command above only modifies files under /opt/homebrew (on Apple Silicon).
# For this reason, the installation does not automatically modify the PATH
# variable. For this reason, the installation script instructs the user to
# manually configure the current shell (Zsh in this case) approritately.
#
# Don't worry because 90-symlink-dotfiles should populate zsh init scripts such
# that new shells evaluate Homebrew's environment appropriately.
