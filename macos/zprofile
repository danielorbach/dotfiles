# Zsh Login Configuration File (~/.zprofile)
#
# This file is sourced by Zsh for login shells, which are initiated during the
# start of a new session (e.g. logging in via a terminal, SSH, or on macOS when
# opening the terminal for the first time). Its purpose is to define settings
# and commands that should be run once per login session.
#
# Usage:
# - Use this file for environment variables, session-wide initialization, or
#   commands that should run once per session (i.e. process tree).
# - Avoid placing interactive or per-shell configurations here; use ~/.zshrc
#   for those.
# - Avoid placing settings needed by non-interactive shells; use ~/.zshenv
#   instead.
#
# Order of Execution:
# ~/.zprofile is executed for login shells, after:
#   1. ~/.zshenv (universal environment settings)
# and before:
#   2. ~/.zshrc (interactive shell-specific settings)
#
# Note:
# Keep this file focused on session-wide tasks, such as:
# - Setting up persistent environment variables (e.g., PATH, LANG).
# - Initializing SSH agents or other services needed for the session.
# - Running commands that must execute only once.
