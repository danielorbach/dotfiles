# Zsh Environment Configuration File (~/.zshenv)
#
# This file is sourced by every Zsh session, be it interactive, non-interactive
# login, and non-login. Its purpose is to define environment variables and
# perform minimal, universal setup applicable to all shells.
#
# Usage:
# - Reserve this file for essential environment settings only.
# - Avoid commands, aliases, or configurations meant for interactive use.
#
# Order of Execution:
# ~/.zshenv is executed before:
#   1. ~/.zprofile (login shells)
#   2. ~/.zshrc (interactive shells)
#   3. ~/.zlogout (on shell exit)
#
# Best Practices:
# - Keep this file minimal to avoid unnecessary overhead for non-interactive shells.
# - Avoid defining aliases, functions, or interactive shell configurations here.
# - Focus on exporting essential environment variables (e.g., PATH, LANG, EDITOR).
#
# Note:
# Improper changes here may disrupt both scripts and interactive sessions.
# Test thoroughly.
