# Zsh Interactive Configuration File (~/.zshrc)
#
# This file is sourced by Zsh for every interactive shells. Its purpose is to
# define configurations, aliases, functions, and settings that enhance your
# interactive shell experience.
#
# Usage:
# - Use this file for interactive shell-specific settings.
# - Avoid placing environment variables or non-interactive settings here;
#   use ~/.zshenv for those.
# - Avoid running slow commands that should run only once per process tree;
#   use ~/.zprofile for those.
#
# Order of Execution:
# ~/.zshrc is executed only for interactive shells, after:
#   1. ~/.zshenv (universal environment settings)
#   2. ~/.zprofile have already run once during the initial login
# It is skipped in non-interactive contexts (e.g., shell scripts).
#
# Note:
# This file affects your interactive workflow. Keep it organized and modular
# to ensure a clean, maintainable setup.
