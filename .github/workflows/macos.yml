# Dotfiles Installation (macOS)
#
# This workflow automates the installation and setup of dotfiles on macOS environments.
# It handles the complete process from cleaning up existing software to verifying the
# installation and running tests.
#
# Currently, this workflow is designed to run on Apple Silicon only. As new operating
# systems are released, the matrix strategy can be updated manually to include additional
# versions.
#
# The workflow can be triggered by pushing changes to main, creating pull requests, or
# manually through workflow dispatch.
